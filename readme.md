# Food Menu Application

This project demonstrates the use of **JavaScript object and array destructuring** with a sample dataset of food items. It includes various techniques for destructuring nested objects and arrays from an object.

## Project Structure

The project includes a dataset that represents food items with categories and details like ingredients, prices, and types.

### Data Structure
The data is represented as an object containing a category and an array of food items. Each food item is an object with properties such as `name`, `price`, and `ingredients`.

### Sample Data:

```javascript
const myData = {
    category: "Food",
    items: [
        {
            name: "Pizza",
            price: 10,
            ingredients: {
                dough: "Wheat",
                cheese: "Mozzarella",
                toppings: ["Pepperoni", "Olives"]
            }
        },
        {
            name: "Burger",
            price: 8,
            ingredients: {
                bun: "Sesame",
                cheese: "Cheddar",
                toppings: ["Lettuce", "Tomato", "Onion"]
            }
        },
        {
            name: "Pasta",
            price: 12,
            ingredients: {
                pastaType: "Penne",
                sauce: "Tomato",
                extras: ["Parmesan", "Basil"]
            }
        }
    ]
};
```

## Key Concepts Covered

### Array Destructuring

Using array destructuring, we extract each food item from the `items` array:

```javascript
const [x, y, z] = myData.items;
console.log(x, y, z);
```

Here:
- `x` will hold the first item (`Pizza`)
- `y` will hold the second item (`Burger`)
- `z` will hold the third item (`Pasta`)

### Object Destructuring

You can destructure properties of an object, like this:

```javascript
const { name, price } = myData.items[0]; // Destructures 'Pizza'
console.log(name, price); // Output: Pizza 10
```

Additionally, you can destructure nested properties, like the ingredients:

```javascript
const { bun, cheese, toppings } = y.ingredients;
console.log(bun, cheese); // Output: Sesame Cheddar
```

### Example Output

If you run the code with the sample data, you will get the following outputs:

- For `Pizza`: 
  ```
  Pizza 10
  ```

- For `Burger` ingredients:
  ```
  Sesame Cheddar
  ```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Include the above JavaScript code in your project.
3. Open the developer console in your browser and run the script to see the output of destructuring arrays and objects.

1. filter() : The filter() method creates a new array with elements that pass the test defined by the provided function.

2. map() : The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array.

3. reduce() : The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value. 


4. find() : The find() method returns the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.

5. sort() : The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. By default, sort() converts elements to strings and sorts them lexicographically. 

6. Conclusion : This example shows how powerful JavaScript array methods can be in manipulating and transforming data. From filtering specific elements, mapping new arrays, reducing them to single values, finding elements, to sorting them based on custom criteria, these methods provide a lot of flexibility for developers.

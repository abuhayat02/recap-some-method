1. filter() : The filter() method creates a new array with elements that pass the test defined by the provided function.

2. map() : The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array.

3. reduce() : The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value. 


4. find() : The find() method returns the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.

5. sort() : The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. By default, sort() converts elements to strings and sorts them lexicographically. 

6. Conclusion : This example shows how powerful JavaScript array methods can be in manipulating and transforming data. From filtering specific elements, mapping new arrays, reducing them to single values, finding elements, to sorting them based on custom criteria, these methods provide a lot of flexibility for developers.
